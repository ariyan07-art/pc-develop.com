 1. Understand the Problem Clearly

    Ask them to describe the issue: "What exactly is not working?"

    When did the problem start?

    Does it happen with a specific app or all the time?

Example questions:

    Does the computer turn on?

    Is there any error message?

    Is anything showing on the screen?

    Are the sound, mouse, and keyboard working?

 2. Basic Troubleshooting Steps
Hardware:

    Make sure all cables and plugs are properly connected.

    Check if the monitor and power supply are working.

    Try using a different mouse or keyboard.

Software:

    Try booting in Safe Mode.

    Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and check CPU/Memory usage.

    Ask if they installed any new software recently.

 3. Use the Right Tools

    Command Prompt: Run commands like sfc /scannow, chkdsk, or ping.

    Device Manager: Check for driver issues.

    Windows Update: Make sure all updates are installed.

 4. Use Restore or Reset if Needed

    Use System Restore to go back to a previous working state.

    If nothing works, you might need to reset or reinstall Windows.

 5. Helpful Tools for Diagnosis

    TeamViewer / AnyDesk: Use for remote support.

    CrystalDiskInfo: To check hard disk health.

    HWMonitor: To monitor temperature and voltage.

Resetting a PC (especially Windows 10 or Windows 11) is a good way to fix issues by reinstalling the OS and giving your system a fresh start. Here's how to do it step-by-step:
 How to Reset a Windows PC
 Option 1: From Windows Settings (If your PC can boot)

    Go to:
    Start > Settings > System > Recovery
    (In Windows 10, it's Settings > Update & Security > Recovery)

    Under "Recovery options", click “Reset this PC”.

    Choose one of the following:

        Keep my files: Reinstalls Windows but keeps your personal files.

        Remove everything: Deletes all files, apps, and settings (full clean install).

    Select:

        Cloud download: Downloads a fresh copy of Windows from Microsoft.

        Local reinstall: Reinstalls from files already on your PC.

    Follow the prompts and click Reset.

 Option 2: If Windows Won’t Boot (Use Recovery Environment)

    Turn on your PC and force shut it down (hold the power button) 2–3 times during boot. This will launch Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).

    In WinRE, select:

        Troubleshoot > Reset this PC

    Then follow the same steps:

        Keep my files or Remove everything

        Cloud or Local reinstall

 Important Notes:

    Back up important data before choosing "Remove everything".

    Resetting removes all installed software unless you choose “Keep my files”.

    If your PC came with manufacturer software (like drivers), a factory reset from boot might preserve those.

5. Turn On Storage Sense (Optional Automation)

    Go to Settings > System > Storage.

    Turn on Storage Sense.

    Configure it to auto-delete temp files, unused files, and recycle bin content.

 6. Move Files to Another Drive or Cloud

    Move large files (videos, photos, documents) to:

  <title>How to Restart GPU</title>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;">How to Restart GPU</span>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
Restarting your GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) can help fix display glitches, driver issues, or performance problems. There are a few ways to do this depending on the situation.
 Method 1: Quick GPU Reset with a Shortcut (Windows)

This is the fastest way to restart your GPU without rebooting your PC.
 Press:

Ctrl + Shift + Win + B

 What happens:

    The screen will go black for a second.

    You’ll hear a beep.

    The display driver restarts.

    No programs will be closed.

 Method 2: Restart GPU Driver via Device Manager

If you're having deeper driver issues:

    Press Windows + X > Click Device Manager

    Expand Display adapters

    Right-click your GPU (e.g., NVIDIA or AMD)

    Click Disable device

    Wait a few seconds, then Enable device

 Method 3: Reinstall or Update GPU Driver

For persistent issues, consider reinstalling the driver:
NVIDIA / AMD / Intel:

    Use Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) in Safe Mode to fully remove the driver.

    Then reinstall the latest version from the official website:

        NVIDIA Drivers

        AMD Drivers

        Intel Drivers

 Method 4: Restart PC (Full GPU Reset)

Sometimes, a full reboot is the best and safest way to reset your GPU, especially after a crash.

  </div>

When a PC crashes, it usually means the system has encountered an error it couldn’t recover from, forcing a freeze, reboot, or shutdown. Crashes can be frustrating, but they almost always have a cause. Here are the main reasons why a PC might crash:
 1. Hardware Problems

    Overheating (CPU or GPU gets too hot)

    Faulty RAM or storage drive (e.g., bad sectors on SSD/HDD)

    Power supply issues

    Loose cables or poor connections

 2. Driver Issues

    Outdated, corrupted, or incompatible drivers—especially for graphics cards, sound cards, or network adapters.

    GPU driver crashes are a very common cause of blue screen errors or freezing.

 3. Malware or Viruses

    Some malware can corrupt system files or overload your system with processes, leading to instability and crashes.

 4. Operating System Errors

    Corrupted system files (e.g., from improper shutdowns or interrupted updates)

    Failing Windows updates

    Registry errors

 5. Software Conflicts

    Two programs conflicting with each other (like antivirus tools or overlay apps)

    Poorly optimized or buggy software (especially games or GPU-heavy applications)

 6. Overclocking / BIOS Settings

    Overclocking CPU or GPU without proper cooling can crash the system.

    Incorrect BIOS settings can also cause instability.

 7. Insufficient Resources

    Running too many programs or demanding apps without enough RAM or CPU power.

    Disk nearly full—especially the C: drive.

 How to Start Diagnosing:

    Run Windows Memory Diagnostic for RAM

    Use CrystalDiskInfo or chkdsk for storage health

    Check Event Viewer for crash logs

    Update all drivers (GPU, chipset, etc.)

    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;">Checking RAM health</span>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
To check the health of your RAM (Random Access Memory), you can use several built-in tools and third-party software. Here’s how you can do it:
1. Windows Memory Diagnostic (Built-in Tool)

This is the simplest way to check for memory issues in Windows.
Steps:

    Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog.

    Type mdsched.exe and press Enter.

    Choose either:

        Restart now and check for problems (immediate check)

        Check for problems the next time I start my computer (check after reboot)

    Windows will restart and perform the memory test. It will automatically check for any issues with your RAM.

    After the test completes, Windows will show the results in the Event Viewer.

To view results in Event Viewer:

    Press Windows + X and select Event Viewer.

    In the left pane, go to Windows Logs > System.

    Look for events with the Source as "MemoryDiagnostics-Results."

2. Using MemTest86 (Third-Party Tool)

If you want a more thorough check, MemTest86 is one of the best tools available for testing RAM.
Steps:

    Download MemTest86 from here.

    Create a bootable USB drive with MemTest86 using the tool provided on the website.

    Restart your computer and boot from the USB drive (you might need to change boot order in BIOS).

    MemTest86 will automatically start and begin testing your RAM.

    Let it run for a few passes (it may take a few hours depending on the size of your RAM). If errors are found, it will display them.

3. Using Third-Party Software (e.g., CPU-Z)

While CPU-Z doesn’t directly test RAM health, it helps to view detailed information about your RAM’s specs and status, which can be useful when diagnosing issues.
Steps:

    Download CPU-Z from here.

    Install and run the program.

    Go to the Memory tab to see details about your RAM speed, size, type, and more.

4. Check for Physical RAM Issues

If you suspect there is a physical issue with your RAM, you can try the following:

    Reseat the RAM: Turn off the computer, remove the RAM sticks, and reinsert them to ensure proper connection.

    Test each stick individually: If you have more than one RAM stick, try booting with one stick at a time to see if a specific stick is causing the problem.
